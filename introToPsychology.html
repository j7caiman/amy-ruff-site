<p><h4>High School Introduction to Psychology Course 2016-17</h4></p>
<p><h5>(Honors or AP Track)</h5></p>
<p>Amy Ruff&rsquo;s Homeschool Tutorials</p>
<p>Contact her here: <a href="contact.html">link</a></p>
<p><strong>Prospectus</strong>:<em> </em>I&rsquo;m going to make a bold prediction: <strong>Introduction to Psychology will be your favorite class</strong>, but not just for this school year&mdash;a<strong> favorite of your entire high school experience!</strong> I&rsquo;m not predicting you&rsquo;ll be a psych major in college or need a psychiatrist&rsquo;s therapy by age 25, but I am certain that you will be zealous to do your psych homework, engage in psych class discussion, &amp; apply psych material in your everyday life&mdash;because this science is absolutely fascinating! </p>
<p>Whether you&rsquo;re already exposed to a fair amount of popular psycho-babble lit on the market today or coming at this class as a complete novice, you will love the combination of challenging &amp; sensible, academic &amp; practical material that is<strong> all about you</strong>. If you&rsquo;ve taken literary studies with me, then you know that <strong><em>psyche</em></strong><strong> means &ldquo;soul&rdquo;</strong> in Greek &amp; that the <strong>human soul is comprised of three invisible-yet-very-real forces</strong>: <strong>intellect/mind, emotions/feelings, &amp; volition/will.</strong></p>
<p>Intro Psych will develop your ability to <strong>identify different types of people &amp; grasp the why behind each type</strong>. And guess what? That insight includes <strong>understanding yourself better</strong> in order to <strong>grow confidently into the person you are wired to be &amp; to live conscientiously as the person you want to be</strong>. Did you catch that? Nature plays a central role in who you are, but let&rsquo;s also remember the significance of nurture. </p>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong>: <strong>Intro Psych is loaded with take-away!</strong> Since you&rsquo;ll spend your life on Earth communicating &amp; working with&mdash;or maybe at times just tolerating&mdash;other humans, Intro Psych is your chance to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn <strong>brain science</strong> that will <strong>equip you to study smarter, not harder</strong>. Sound valuable?</li>
<li>Nail down the biological basics behind <strong>optimizing the performance of your psyche</strong>&mdash;as in, adequate <strong>sleep enables learning</strong> &amp; <strong>dietary self-discipline fuels endocrine balance &amp; function</strong>. Sound like an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure?</li>
<li><strong>Understand how a human being develops before </strong>you launch out &amp; become a parent. How many people <strong>enter the critically important career of parenting</strong> without studying a drop of developmental psychology?</li>
<li><strong>Identify signs of aberrant human behavior, so you can be on the global team of humanity to help someone&mdash;maybe yourself&mdash;when psychological well-being appears compromised. </strong></li>
</ul>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><strong><em>This Just Got Real: A Tragic Vignette of the Psyche</em></strong><em> </em><strong></strong><em>A close friend from my undergrad years at Duke visited me in July. Our discussions have always gone from deep to deeper over the years. She is distinguished in her professional field of psychology &amp; also had experienced a personal psychological tragedy when her father committed suicide by jumping off a bridge. Regardless of her level of experience &amp; despite her breadth of knowledge, my friend absolutely missed the signs that something was gravely wrong in the post-partum psyche of a first-time mom. This beautiful young mom of a precious baby girl took her own life. Without an undue degree of guilt, my friend acknowledged to me a sense of responsibility in this tragic situation. In hindsight, my friend now sees the warning signs that sadly went unaddressed by her, a loving husband, a devoted grandma, &amp; others. </em><strong><em>Vignette Take-Away</em></strong><em>: Application of our psych material can get very real&mdash;very fast! Someone who is &ldquo;on your watch/in your circle&rdquo; may be facing a similar challenge of psyche. Intro Psych will help you to notice, care about, &amp; hopefully help if such a soul crosses your path in life. It&rsquo;s time to ditch the stigma attached to mental illness by replacing misinformed beliefs &amp; irrational fears with knowledge &amp; understanding that&rsquo;s coated in compassion. &ndash;Amy Ruff</em><em> </em></p>
<p>In Intro Psych this year, we&rsquo;ll ask hard questions &amp; seek informed answers. </p>
<p>I hope you&rsquo;ll take the challenge &amp; join us!</p>
<p>Introduction to Psychology students <strong>select &amp; follow 1 of the 2 tracks described below</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Directions for Deciding Which Track to Take</strong>: Intro Psych will have 2 tracks as follows. Though the <strong>AP track</strong> may sound like a greater level of work, it more accurately <strong>involves more focused work</strong>. In deciding between AP &amp; HT, remember that <strong>almost every college major these days requires Intro Psych</strong>, so <strong>taking the May 2017 AP Psych Exam</strong> will likely help you <strong>gain needed credit for college</strong>&mdash;<strong>unless you&rsquo;ll major in psych</strong> in which case the AP <strong>credit would &ldquo;advance place&rdquo; the student</strong> into a higher level psych course. </p>
<p><strong>Fine Print</strong>: I&rsquo;m pressing out the precise details for HT/AP assignments, incorporating the publisher&rsquo;s legion of teaching material/aids into my syllabus; however, as always with my course work, the <strong>parent is in charge of the student&rsquo;s homeschool </strong>class, so <strong>any assignment on the syllabus may be omitted, altered, etc. as the parent sees fit or the student&rsquo;s schedule necessitates</strong>.</p>
<p><br /><br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>HT (Honors Track)</strong><strong>:</strong> The course&rsquo;s content is heavy enough to merit that all non-AP students are taking an honors-track course, thus eliminating any regular-track option. In short, <strong>honors-track students will:</strong></p>
<p>1) follow the class <strong>syllabus</strong>; 2) complete all <strong>unit</strong> (aka chapters) <strong>reading assignments</strong> (text &amp; online) by their due dates; 3) note chapter objectives &amp; terms/concepts for use<strong> alone or on study teams</strong> (pairs or small groups) to <strong>answer discussion &amp; critical-thinking questions which will be discussed &amp; debated </strong>during class; 4) maintain a <strong>90+% average</strong>; 5) take at home the open-book/open-note unit tests to which the following applies:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Drop Lowest Test Grade</strong><strong>: 1 lowest test grade each semester may be dropped</strong>;</li>
<li><strong>Paper-Instead-of-1-Test Option</strong>: 1 additional test during the entire school year may be replaced by reading 1 of the books on my psych reading list below &amp; writing a paper which demonstrates analytical understanding of the author&rsquo;s argument; in other words, your paper explains the author&rsquo;s assertions on his/her chosen psychological topic. This P-I-T Option may be completed in advance over the summer to submit whenever needed during the school year:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Branden&rsquo;s <em>Honoring the Self: Self-esteem &amp; Personal Transformation</em></li>
<li>Gladwell&rsquo;s <em>Blink: The Power of Thinking without Thinking</em></li>
<li>Goleman&rsquo;s <em>Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ</em></li>
<li>Grossman&rsquo;s <em>On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War &amp; Society</em> (as in societal law enforcement)</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Drs. Joe McIlhaney &amp; Frieda McKissic Bush&rsquo;s <em>Hooked: New [Brain] Science on How Casual Sex Is Affecting Our Children</em></li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>AP (Advanced Placement) Track</strong><strong>: </strong>Specifically, the AP track targets short-essay prompts &amp; vocab/term mastery that will prepare the student to take the May 2017 AP Psych Exam. To ensure preparedness for that AP exam, <strong>AP students</strong> must <strong>do numbers 1-3 </strong>as detailed<strong> above for HT </strong>as well as<strong>: </strong>1) maintain a <strong>93+% average; </strong>&amp; 2) decide by February 2017 if they intend to take the May 1, 2017 AP Psych Exam; 3) <strong>write 1 paper on any title from the following list </strong>to demonstrate analytical understanding of the author&rsquo;s argument, explaining his/her assertions on the psychological topic (Note: This paper could be completed in advance over the summer to ease the academic load during the school year.):</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Branden&rsquo;s <em>Honoring the Self: Self-esteem &amp; Personal Transformation</em></li>
<li>Gladwell&rsquo;s <em>Blink: The Power of Thinking without Thinking</em></li>
<li>Goleman&rsquo;s <em>Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ</em></li>
<li>Grossman&rsquo;s <em>On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War &amp; Society</em> (as in societal law enforcement)</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Drs. Joe McIlhaney &amp; Frieda McKissic Bush&rsquo;s <em>Hooked: New [Brain] Science on How Casual Sex Is Affecting Our Children</em></li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fine Print on AP Students &amp; Unit Tests</strong>: Though I recommend that AP students take the unit tests closed book/note, I also <strong>value the following</strong> <strong>hybrid approach</strong> because the <strong>COURSE OBJECTIVE is MASTERY OF MATERIAL</strong>, not a too-bad-you-missed-that-question approach to testing. The <strong>hybrid concept allows</strong> a student to: a) <strong>attempt the tests closed book/note</strong>; &amp; b)<strong> refer/go to any info</strong> that the student recalls <strong>in the text/notes/online resources</strong> to <strong>clarify a given answer or help fill any knowledge gap(s)</strong> related to a given question, particular unit content, or cumulative course concept.</p>
<p><strong>AP Psychology Exam</strong>: Though <strong>they will prepare</strong> throughout Intro Psych to take the AP Psych Exam, the AP-track students are<strong> not required to register for/take</strong> this exam on <strong>Monday May 1, 2017 at 12 pm</strong>. Please note the following important dates &amp; info from <a href="http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/home">http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/home</a> which Mrs. Ruff will also highlight for the AP track on her syllabus: a) In <strong>January 2017</strong>, contact AP Central &amp; the Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) Coordinator at the testing-site school (likely NCSSM = NC School of Science &amp; Math) if you need testing accommodations &amp; then immediately submit requests for testing accommodations; b) In <strong>February 2017</strong>, &ldquo;homeschooled students whose school districts do not offer APs must contact AP Services to obtain a list of local AP Coordinators/schools where they could arrange to test &amp; then immediately contact those AP Coordinators/schools to complete the paperwork to take the AP&rdquo; exam at the referenced school.</p>
<p><strong>Student Age &amp; Course Unit Value</strong>: High school social science, science, or elective = 1 unit. Recommended student age ranges from advanced 8th grade to high school. </p>

Mrs. Ruff homeschooled her 4 children, all of whom are now adults &amp; remain big fans of homeschooling. She received a BA in 1989 from Duke University with double majors in English &amp; religion along with a Certificate in Women's Studies. Having studied Spanish in boarding school &amp; at Duke, Mrs. Ruff served on the short-term mission field as a Spanish interpreter. Before having her first child, Mrs. Ruff worked in editing for the Duke University Press &amp; has continued to freelance edit over the years. Mrs. Ruff has been teaching tutorials in her home, at her church, &amp; through a cooperative since 1999. She &amp; her husband have been members of Grace Church in Chapel Hill since they were undergrads. Since 1999 Amy Ruff has been a member of North Carolinians for Home Education, &amp; for two terms she served as Chair of a Durham homeschool support group, C.H.E.A.G.D.

<p><strong>Class Location/Dates/Times</strong>: Class will be held at Amy Ruff&rsquo;s home near Duke: 1101 Anderson St., Durham, 27705. The <strong>girls&rsquo;</strong> class will be on <strong>Wednesday </strong>from <strong>200-330, </strong>&amp; the <strong>boys&rsquo; </strong>class will be on <strong>Thursday </strong>from <strong>130-300; classes run from W/Th 8/24 &amp; 25</strong> to <strong>12/14 &amp; 15</strong> &amp; then <strong>resume from 1/4 &amp; 5 to 5/10 &amp; 11</strong>. Class will not meet for Mrs. Ruff&rsquo;s <strong>fall 10/12 &amp; 13 &amp; spring 3/8 &amp; 9 breaks</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Telecommuting is an option:</strong> I&rsquo;ve been doing expeditious, successful SAT/ACT prep &amp; other private &amp; semi-private tutoring via FaceTime, Skype, Google Hangouts, so feel free to seek advance permission if this option interests you.</p>
<p><strong>Registration, Tuition, &amp; Materials</strong>: Our terrific text is <em>Psychology for AP </em>by David G. Myers in the 2nd edition &amp; should be ordered either new or used online <strong>ISBN</strong> 978-1-4641-1307-9.</p>
<p>For last year&rsquo;s psychology class, I was able to engage 2 excellent guest lecturers: a Duke MD &amp; a UNC PhD. I&rsquo;m hoping that the busy professional schedules of those 2 gifted academics will allow them to enrich our class again this year. Adding to the enrichment, one of our brilliant guests works in the unique field of forensic psychology, directing the Program on Childhood Trauma &amp; Maltreatment in UNC&rsquo;s Department of Psychiatry &amp; bearing a resemblance to&mdash;you guessed it&mdash;</p>
