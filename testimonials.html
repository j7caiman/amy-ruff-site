    <p><strong>Kendrick V., Harvard 2017 (Majors in Economics and Computer Science):</strong> "Mrs. Ruff’s English classes prepared me exceptionally well for the writing demands of Harvard. I thrived in my required freshman writing course, earning an A. Specifically, I found my ability to structure a paper to far exceed that of my peers. Now, as a senior, I am known among my peers as an excellent editor and have edited several senior theses for friends this spring. However, to say Mrs. Ruff’s courses improved only my writing ability would be insufficient. The benefits of her courses have extended beyond English classes. All courses at Harvard require the ability to think clearly and formulate a sound argument. I attribute my success at Harvard, in large part, to Mrs. Ruff’s development of my critical-thinking skills."</p>
    
    <p><strong>Joan M., a Chapel Hill mom & professional teacher:</strong> My son, Marlow, took Amy Ruff's Spanish class during his 7th and 8th grade years. Amy's Spanish 1 and 2 use an older textbook because, she says, "The newer text books just don’t cover enough material—especially for their price."  Amy and Marlow decided to play it safe and put Marlow in Spanish 2 this year, his freshman year at Chapel Hill High School. Well, he should really have been placed in Spanish 3 as he has been top of his CHHS Spanish class grade-wise all year with absolutely no effort on his part. In other words, what Amy Ruff calls Spanish 1 and 2 is really high school Spanish 1, 2, and at least a 1/2 year of Spanish 3. She covers a lot of material in that one to one & a quarter hour once a week! Marlow just received the results from the National Spanish 2 Exam and placed third in the State of North Carolina. Considering he has learned no new material in Spanish 2 at CHHS, this is Marlow and Amy Ruff's win! She's that good. Do I recommend Amy Ruff? Yes! Two thumbs up!</p>

    <p><strong>Jeffrey Wubbenhorst (Duke University):</strong> "Mrs. Ruff's role in my family has moved from teacher to advisor to something close to a life coach. From teaching my first composition class to writing my recommendation letter for Duke, Mrs. Ruff has been an excellent teacher and supporting figure, as well as a good family friend."<br>"I had the undesirable experience in high school of dealing with not one but two concussions, events which Mrs. Ruff was very flexible with. I have taken Spanish, composition, English, and British literature with Mrs. Ruff, and have nothing but good things to say about her teaching style and knowledge. One detail that I regard as unique in Mrs. Ruff is her abilities as a fair grader; one can be confident of a low grade if a shoddy product is submitted, but also expect understanding and flexibility in the case of disability of inexperience. Mrs. Ruff meets students where they are at, but also won’t let more talented students get away with handing in material they didn’t work for."</p>

    <blockquote>"My family and I recommend Mrs. Ruff wholeheartedly. We are incredibly thankful for all the things she and her family have done for us, and look forward to many more years of knowing the Ruffs."</blockquote>
